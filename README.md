    *   **Speech-to-Text Notes:** Effortlessly capture spoken words into editable text.
    *   **Voice Notes:** Record and manage audio notes directly within the app.
    *   **Image Notes:** Integrate visual content seamlessly into your note-taking workflow.
*   **AI Chatbot Image Support:** Empowering the AI chatbot to process and respond to image-based queries and content.
*   **Advanced Debugging (Logfinder):** Integrating a sophisticated Logfinder tool for in-depth application diagnostics and error resolution.

## Technologies Used

-   **Flutter (Version 3.25.1):** The primary framework for building the cross-platform user interface and application logic, updated for enhanced performance and new capabilities.
-   **Firebase:**
    -   Authentication: For secure user account management and access control.
    -   Firestore Database: For real-time data storage, synchronization, and an administrative panel.
    -   Cloud Functions: Utilized for sophisticated background worker operations and server-side logic.
-   **Hive:** A lightweight, exceptionally fast NoSQL database used for robust local data storage and seamless offline access.
-   **API Integration:** Flutter's `http` package (or similar) for fetching notes and interacting with backend services.
-   **Google AI Studio API (or similar):** For powering advanced AI features, including note summarization and conversational assistance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run **MS Bridge** on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and services are available on your system:

-   **Flutter SDK** (version `3.25.1` or higher)
    📖 [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
-   **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extension
-   **Firebase Project** for authentication, data storage, and cloud functions
-   **API Key** for AI Summarization and conversational features (e.g., Google AI Studio API)
-   **Keystore** (for signed APK generation)
    > _Note: The password for the keystore is not provided and should be managed securely._

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafay99-epic/MSBridge
cd MSBridge
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Configure Firebase

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2.  **Integrate Firebase with Flutter App:**
    Follow Firebase’s official guide to register your app and download the configuration files:

    -   `google-services.json` → Place in `android/app/`
    -   `GoogleService-Info.plist` → Place in `ios/Runner/`

3.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    -   Enable **Authentication** (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
    -   Enable **Firestore Database** and configure security rules as needed.
    -   Configure any other necessary Firebase services (e.g., Cloud Functions for background tasks).

### Firebase & AI API Key Configuration

Edit the configuration file (e.g., `lib/config.dart` or utilize environment variables for enhanced security) and replace placeholder values with your actual Firebase and AI API credentials:

```dart
// Example structure - for production, use environment variables (e.g., with flutter_dotenv)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY',
  authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_SENDER_ID',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID',
};

const aiApiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY'; // Or other AI service API key
```

> **Important Security Tip:** Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials directly to version control. It is highly recommended to use `.env` files (e.g., via the `flutter_dotenv` package) or secure key management practices for production environments to prevent exposure.

You may also need to update platform-specific configuration files:

-   `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
-   `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

### AI Integration Setup

-   Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or your chosen AI service provider.
-   Integrate this key securely into your application, referencing the configuration guidance above.

### Keystore for Signed APKs

To build signed APKs for release, you will need a keystore:

1.  Generate a new keystore (if you don't already have one):
    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore msbridge_keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias msbridge
    ```
2.  Place the generated `msbridge_keystore.jks` file in your project's `android` directory.
3.  Update your `android/key.properties` and `android/app/build.gradle` files with the keystore details and credentials for signing.

> _The password for the signing key is not provided and must be managed securely and separately._

### Run the Application

Use the following command to start the application on a connected device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

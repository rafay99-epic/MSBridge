# MS Bridge

MS Bridge is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter, designed for seamless lecture note reading and note-taking. It supports both online and offline modes, allowing users to effortlessly switch between them manually or automatically based on network availability.

The app integrates Firebase for authentication, real-time data synchronization, and an admin panel, ensuring secure and efficient note management. For offline access, it utilizes Hive as a robust local storage solution, enabling users to read and manage their notes anytime, anywhere.

With MS Bridge, you get a reliable, user-friendly platform for organizing and accessing your study materials without interruptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter (Version 3.22.2):** The primary framework for building the user interface and application logic.
- **Firebase:**
  - Authentication: For user account management and secure access.
  - Realtime Database / Firestore: For data storage and synchronization.
  - Web Hosting or App hosting: For hosting CMS.
- **Hive:** A lightweight NoSQL database for local data storage.
- **API Calls:** Flutter's `http` package (or similar) for fetching notes from the backend API.
- **AI Integration:** Google AI Studio API for AI-powered note summarization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run **MS Bridge** on your local development environment.

### üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and services are available on your system:

- **Flutter SDK** (version `3.22.2` or higher)  
  üìñ [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extension
- **Firebase Project** for authentication and data storage
- **API Key** for AI Summarization _(Google Studio API)_
- **Keystore** (for signed APK generation)
  > _Note: The password for the keystore is not provided._

---

### üîß Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafay99-epic/MSBridge
cd MSBridge
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Configure Firebase

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**  
   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Integrate Firebase with Flutter App:**  
   Follow Firebase‚Äôs guide to register your app and download the configuration files:

   - `google-services.json` ‚Üí Place in `android/app/`
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` ‚Üí Place in `ios/Runner/`

3. **Enable Firebase Services:**
   - Enable **Authentication** (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
   - Enable **Firestore Database** and configure security rules as needed

---

### üîê Firebase & API Key Configuration

Edit the config file (e.g., `lib/config.dart`) and replace placeholder values with your actual Firebase and API credentials:

```dart
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_SENDER_ID',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID',
};

const aiApiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY';
```

> üí° **Tip:** Never commit API keys to version control. Use `.env` or secure key management.

You may also need to update:

- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

---

### ü§ñ AI Summarization Setup

- Sign up and get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Paste the key in `lib/config.dart` under `aiApiKey`

---

### üì¶ Keystore for Signed APKs

To build signed APKs:

1. Generate a keystore:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore msbridge_keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias msbridge
   ```
2. Place the keystore in the project root.
3. Update your `android/key.properties` and `build.gradle` files accordingly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _The password for the signing key is not provided and must be managed securely._

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

Use the following command to start the app:

```bash
flutter run
```
